# Progress Log - Apprie Platform Optimization (v2.1)

## [2026-01-03] - Platform Restructuring and Optimization

### Completed Tasks
- **Optimization & Speed:**
    - Restructured the platform from a single-page React app to a high-performance **Multi-Page Static Site** (`index.html`, `about.html`, `products.html`, `support.html`).
    - Implemented **Lazy Loading** for all heavy image assets (`about/`, `team/`, `portfolio/`).
    - Minified CSS transitions and updated `netlify.toml` for optimized routing.
- **Navigation & Layout:**
    - Updated Navbar to focus on core conversion paths: `Products`, `Support`, `Contact`.
    - Created a standalone `about.html` page to host the **History** and **Team** sections.
- **Product Expansion:**
    - **Medical Copilot:** Re-positioned as the flagship AI tool with a floating "Try Copilot" button and detailed RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities.
    - **Health Coaching:** Implemented a Bevel/Strava-inspired feature list with a clear **$29.99/year** subscription model.
    - **Research Platforms:** Added dedicated sections for **Drug Discovery** (AI molecule modeling) and **Digital Twin** (longitudinal health forecasting).
- **Support & B2B:**
    - Built a tiered support system: **Researcher (Free)**, **Professional ($499/mo)**, and **Enterprise (Custom)**.
    - Added a detailed **White-labeling** section featuring API access, custom branding, and compliance documentation kits.
- **Typography & Branding:**
    - Replaced the industrial "Roboto Slab" with **Lora** (a sophisticated serif) for body text to improve trustworthiness and elegance.
    - Replaced UI fonts with **Inter** (modern high-end sans-serif) for improved readability and a premium tech feel.

### Technical Notes
- Multi-page structure significantly improves First Contentful Paint (FCP) and SEO by reducing JavaScript bundle overhead.
- Netlify redirects updated to support direct access to `.html` routes.
